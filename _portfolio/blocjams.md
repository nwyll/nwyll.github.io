## BlocJams
-----------
BlocJams is a prototype digital music player, like Spotify (minus the commercials). BlocJams was my first front-end project. The focus was on using HTML5, CSS styling, DOM scripting, JQuery, and JavaScript. BlocJams also introduced best-practices for responsive design, CSS transitions, and project management through Git and GitHub.

## Technology Used
------------------
#### JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, HTML5
