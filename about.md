Hi! My name is Natalie Wyll. Since I get asked a lot it's pronounced "While", like 'See y'all in a while!" I grew up in Austin, Texas (hence the y'all). Iâ€™m passionate about fitness, you can find me at the gym lifting heavy things. I also love to travel, read, going to the movies and trying new vegan recipes.

I graduated with a degree in Architectural Engineering from the University of Texas. After working as a structural engineer for a few years I transitioned into teaching. Where I taught both advanced mathematics and engineering. Along the way I also received my Master's in Science and Engineering Education, also from the University of Texas. I am passionate about engineering education and a lifelong learner. But after 7 years in the classroom, I missed creating things. This lead me on a path to becoming a software developer.
