title: All my CS Ladies ... Please, put you hands up.
---

I recently came across a [blog post](https://shift.newco.co/what-its-like-to-be-a-woman-at-a-tech-conference-8a1a299ac82b) by Chloe Condon about her experience as a woman at a tech conference. The post was written in good humor but points out a very real issue in the tech industry. Over the next few days, I kept thinking about the post. The cover picture (shown below) kept popping up in the back of my mind. I couldn't get it out of my head, it was just so striking and felt so familiar.

For some context, I have a degree in engineering as well as a master's in engineering education. So I do know what it is like to be a woman in the world of engineering. So, why was this post plaguing me? This phenomenon is not new. It is well documented. Then I realized ...  I was disappointed. (*And a little scared for my future career prospects*). I am just entering the field and my goal is to become a software developer. I was having flashbacks from when I would tell people I was a structural engineer or that I taught engineering and their response was **_always_** one of shock.

### *Really?*

From the outside, the tech industry seemed to be more progressive and I guess I had hoped for a different experience in 2017.

But the article also reminded me of some of the research I did for my master's. Part of my work was looking at the barriers to retention in engineering. We can talk about the STEM pipeline and how it starts in middle school and continues all the way to the university level and beyond to industry. We can discuss how gateway courses at the university level that serve as roadblocks. But one concept that particularly struck me then and has stuck with me to this day is the concept of self-efficacy. In short, self-efficacy is a person’s perception of whether or not they can succeed. Will they be able to reach their goals? This, this was the heart of my worry.

### *Can I really do it?*

Our concept of self-efficacy is influenced by many factors, but one factor that creates and strengthens our self-beliefs of efficacy is through social models. I.E. Seeing people like you reflected in your surrounding being successful. There are two key issues there: 1. seeing people like you and 2. Seeing them be successful. This relates directly to Chloe’s experience, she did not see herself reflected in her surroundings.

So what happens when you don’t see yourself represented in your colleagues, bosses, or mentors? This can affect your perception of whether or not you can or will be able to succeed in a similar endeavor. Ultimately, this can lead some to choose to leave the industry, sometimes before they even get started.

Now I say perception because it is a *perception* and not always a true representation of one’s actual abilities. I remember reading a study where underrepresented minorities (this study was specifically referring to women and people of color) who withdrew from the college of engineering reported lower levels of self-efficacy. When in actuality their grades were comparable or often higher than their white, male counterparts. Now, I am in no way saying that white males are in anyway less qualified. I only wish to point out that our beliefs about our place within a community can be greatly affected by what we see reflected back to us every single day.

The fewer women that women see with in the world of coding, the fewer women we will see in the world of coding. So how do we tackle the issue when we are in a chicken-or-the-egg situation? God, I wish I had that answer. This is a big, multifaceted issue. But I do believe exposure is part of the solution. There are amazing, talented women in tech. So all my CS ladies ... Please, put your hands up! Make yourself known - blog, go to conferences, speak, seek out other women. More exposure for women within the industry will lead to more women entering and staying in the industry.

Finally, a special thank you to the women who have been models to me and have inspired my confidence to pursue a career in software development. I hope in the future I can do the same for others. (*And thanks to Queen B for the title inspiration.*)
