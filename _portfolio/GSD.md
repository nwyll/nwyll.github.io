## GSD
-----------
Do you need to get sh*t done? In today's busy world we are all crunched for time and need 25 hours in a day. while we haven't found a way to cheat the space time-continuum, we have created an application to help you make the most of the time you have.

GSD is a productivity timer that provides a framework for committing to specific work and break periods to reduce distractions and improve time management. GSD follows the traditional Pomodoro method using standardized 25-minute work periods accompanied by set breaks. After each completed work session you can take a 5-min break. Complete 4 work sessions and you get to take a longer 15-min break. Yay! Now go get some stuff done!

## Technology Used

#### ReactJS, Bootstrap
