##### Only 7 easy steps!!! WOW!

**Bull.** If it sounds too good to be true …  well, then it probably is. Research shows that it takes around ten years to develop expertise in an area. So why does everyone make learning to code sound so easy?

I am transitioning into the world of coding as a non-traditional student: I do not have any formal background in computer science or coding. Two months into my journey to become a software developer, my greatest takeaway so far has been learning how shed the perceptions that learning to code is easy. Learning how to be ok feeling lost, over-my-head, and frustrated. *All the time.*

This is a hard transition to make. Especially when the perception is that everyone else just popped out of the womb knowing this stuff and I have to be the last person on earth who doesn’t understand how to do this. Ok, that might be a slight over exaggeration (but only slight). That's how it feels sometimes, especially when headlines like those mentioned above are plastered all over the internet. Everyone is an expert. I don’t see stories of struggle reflected. So that must mean I am not smart enough to do this. (I wrote a previous post on how our surroundings can affect our perception of ability to succeed, check it out [here](/http://nataliewyll.com/2017/07/31/cs-ladies.html).) My hope is that sharing my experiences as a new learner will let others know they are not alone in their struggles.

As a former educator, I truly believe that if you are not out in the weeds a little you are not really learning. I *know* research shows that struggling helps you make sense of a concept and helps build a deeper understanding. But, I haven’t been a student in a while. And there can be a chasm between *knowing something* and *experiencing it* …  And I experience struggle on a daily basis now.

Struggle is often perceived as a failure on the part of the learner. But according to experts in education, it is important for educators to address the fact that the task is difficult and that it is supposed to feel complicated in order to be understood. This helps students mediate their frustration and encourages perseverance. So if you are on this coding journey with me let me say it - Coding is hard, it is supposed to be hard. You won’t be able to solve every problem. That's ok. This is an important part of the learning process. I have to remind myself of this fact all the time.

My advice to people who are new to coding is know that it is ok to struggle. This does not mean you cannot code. Struggle is part of the learning process and truly the only way to learn. There is a point where struggle becomes unproductive, at that point it is time to reach out for help, but don’t be too quick to just copy a solution. But when you find yourself saying I can’t do this, and trust me it will happen. Remember those are just thoughts, not reality. Don’t listen to them. The key to learning to code is getting comfortable with being uncomfortable.

Luckily, I am not the only person to put themselves out there. Here are some other great articles reflecting the real life struggles associated with learning to code:

[How I learned to code in my 30s](https://medium.com/udacity/how-i-learned-to-code-in-my-30s-61ad21180208)

[Why learning to code is so damn hard](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard)

[Don't believe anyone who tells you learning to code is easy](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/dont-believe-anyone-who-tells-you-learning-to-code-is-easy/ )


In an effort to help new learners demystify specific topics and reflect struggle for others, I am starting a series of blogs titled Newbie to Newbie. Where I highlight topics I found difficult to grasp as I go through my journey and I will attempt to cover them in a way that it appropriate for a newbie. So stay tuned.
