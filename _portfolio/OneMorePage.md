## One More Page

Young adult books are for the young and the forever young-at-heart. At One More Page we love YA books just as much as you, possibly even more. What can we say? We’re a little obsessed. Join the One More Page community to find the hottest YA books and meet new friends who share your reading interests. Here’s to late nights reading, telling yourself ... just one more page.

One More Page is a social book club application that allows users to connect with fellow YA devotees. Members can follow current book clubs, create new topics and create new posts and comment on other members posts. Users can also view upcoming and past book clubs.
